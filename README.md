## About Me

My name is Jacob Ian Snyder-Sohl and I primarily go by my middle name. My wife
and I both hyphenated our last names so that we could share in that symbolism
together...also because it sounds cool to say "I've got the Snyder-Sohl"...haha.

## Past Coding Experience

I have tried to teach myself more complicated coding in the past -- I can never
get past basic HTML and CSS knowledge effectively. I end up just copying youtube
tutorials and making small modifications, but honestly have no clue what I am
doing. I have used HTML, CSS, Python and PHP briefly in the past, but hardly
enough to remember or make a big deal about.

## Career Goals

Currently, my career goal is to become an administrator of some sort in the
public education sphere, but I'm obtaining my Master's in Web Design and Online
Communication out of sheer interest and a passion for effective and efficient
communication. With the world trending more towards digitizing communication in
many forms, I want to be best prepared as I can. Who knows? If I learn enough, I
may love to be a web developer!
